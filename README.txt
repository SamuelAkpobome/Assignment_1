The project realised is divided in two main classes :
  - the XMLtoSQL class which main goal is to transfer the data from the XML documents into a database
  - the Ymatrix class which purpose is to output the admittance matrix of the CIM structure based only on the database

Within the Ymatrix class, two others have been used : the complex class (which has been downloaded from internet, see
source in the code line n°2) and a path class which has been created to simplify the Ymatrix class (see the screencast).
